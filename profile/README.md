## Bren School Graduate Programs
**[Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds-program)** [@UCSB-MEDS](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS)

The Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) degree at Bren is a one year professional degree program focused on using data science to advance solutions to environmental problems. 

Data science is a rapidly expanding discipline with a growing market in need of highly skilled, interdisciplinary professionals. As a student, you will be immersed in a collaborative environment in which students are supported by expert faculty and researchers from the Bren School and the National Center of Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS). Supplementing your background in environmental science, you will gain leading-edge data science skills; receive foundational training in the programming languages R, Python, and SQL; and learn how to apply data visualization to share compelling scientific narratives. In the MEDS program, you will gain real-world experience by completing a capstone group project that applies data science to environmental issues.

The MEDS program is intended to be full-time and courses are offered at the UC Santa Barbara and NCEAS campuses. Currently, the Bren School does not offer any online degree options. 

**[Master of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management)**

Bren’s Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) degree is a two-year professional degree program focused on developing solutions to critical environmental problems while preparing students for careers in environmental science and management.

What you gain from the Bren MESM program goes beyond the knowledge and skills to be an environmental leader. You’ll gain the training and confidence to impress employers and make real change in sustainability, conservation, environmental policy, and much more.

*MESM Year One:* The first year of the MESM program is focused on completing nine core courses in natural and social sciences. By the end of Winter Quarter of the first year, students choose their academic specialization. In Spring Quarter, students are assigned to their master’s project. No classes are held during the summer between year one and year two. During the summer, most students complete internships to cultivate their professional network.

*MESM Year Two:* During year two, students will take courses in an area of specialization and work on their master’s project. Students who choose to pursue an optional focus area are required to complete additional focus courses. Master’s projects culminate in a public presentation during Spring Quarter.

The MESM program is intended to be full-time and courses are offered at the UC Santa Barbara campus. Currently, the Bren School does not offer any online degree options. 

**[PhD in Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/phd-environmental-science-and-management)**

Bren’s PhD in Environmental Science and Management is a doctoral program designed to develop the broad knowledge, analytical powers, technical skills, and innovative thinking required to be a leader in your field.

As a Bren doctoral student you have the opportunity to engage in research that crosses disciplines, and to take courses at the Bren School or in other renowned UCSB departments, such as geography, ecology, earth science, economics, political science, and marine biology. Choose from a research track in either Natural Sciences or Engineering, or in Social Sciences.

As a student in the Bren PhD program, you'll benefit from the school’s superb facilities, smaller size, close faculty mentorship, academic excellence, and opportunities to work across disciplines.

The Bren PhD program is mentorship-based; you will work closely with at least one Bren professor in their area of expertise. Your sponsor serves as your student advisor and the chair of your PhD committee. This faculty sponsor is also responsible for providing intellectual support and academic and career advice, as well as assisting you to obtain financial support from Graduate Student Researcher positions, Teaching Assistant positions, fellowships, and other areas of support.

The PhD program is intended to be full-time and courses are offered at the UC Santa Barbara campus. Currently, the Bren School does not offer any online degree options.
